# Angular2-webpack2-skeleton
A simple skeleton project to use Angular2, Webpack2 beta, Boostrap 4 alpha and bootstrap-loader 2 beta together


I created this project as an example for this issue: https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-loader/issues/191#issuecomment-256352654
After that, I decided to update it based on https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-client


## Install global dependencies
I created some scripts inside 'setup' folder to initialize the environment.
If you are already ready, you can execute this (for macOs):

- sudo npm install -g karma-cli
- sudo npm install -g webpack
- sudo npm install -g typescript
- sudo npm install -g typings
- sudo npm install -g remap-istanbul
- sudo npm install -g webdriver-manager
- sudo npm install -g protractor
- sudo npm install -g nsp
- sudo npm install -g codeclimate-test-reporter
- sudo npm install -g istanbul
- sudo npm install -g snyk


## Install local dependencies
`npm install`

## Run with webpack-dev-server (developing mode)
`npm start`

## Build the application in 'dist' folder (debug mode)
`npm run buildDev`

## Build the application in 'dist' folder (production mode)
`npm run build`

## Test (check coverage/html/index.html with the results)
`npm test`
