# Angular4-webpack2-skeleton
A simple skeleton project to use Angular4, Webpack2, Boostrap 4 alpha and bootstrap-loader 2 beta together


I created this project as an example for this issue: https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-loader/issues/191#issuecomment-256352654
After that, I decided to update it based on https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-client
And I created some branches for this issue: https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin/issues/481

This project is a personal skeleton. If you want to use it feel free to fork it.
I share this with you as it is.

I'll update this project in the future and I'll change the name to another one when Angular4 will be released.

## Install global dependencies
I created some scripts inside 'setup' folder to initialize the environment.
If you are already ready, you can execute this (`sudo` if you are using macOS):

- `npm install -g lite-server`

## Install local dependencies
- `npm install`

## Run with webpack-dev-server (developing mode)
- `npm start`

## Build the application in 'dist' folder (debug mode)
- `npm run build:dev`
- `cd dist`
- `lite-server`

## Build the application in 'dist' folder (production mode)
- `npm run build:prod`
- `cd dist`
- `lite-server`

## Build the application in 'dist' folder (production + AOT mode)
- `npm run build:prod:aot`
- `cd dist`
- `lite-server`

## Test (check coverage/html/index.html with the results)
- `npm test`

## Test e2e with protractor (broken)
~~- `npm run e2e`~~

I'll fix this issue in upcoming versions. Please be patient.
